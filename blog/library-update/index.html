<h2>Library Update</h2>

<p>I finally got around to cataloging (some of) my personal library and have made a page dedicated to the books of my library for those interested.</p>
<p>The plan is to use this as a means of keeping track of what books I have, which of them I have read and whether there is any content I have relating to it. As well as keeping a list I can access when out and about in case I need a reminder of which books I own. It is also a useful way to share my library with friends that may wish to borrow something from me.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t decided on a system of sorting the page yet. I checked <a href="https://lukesmith.xyz/library">Luke Smith&rsquo;s library</a> page and saw that he uses the Library of Congress system. Which doesn&rsquo;t seem appropriate for my uses. For now I have opted for categorising books based on which genre I believe is most appropriate.</p>
<p>There is also the question of whether to include the likes of manga or mass market paperback fiction titles as these aren&rsquo;t as meaningful as other texts although most of the ones I find myself owning are of a higher quality than one would find on the best sellers list or the advertising shelves at a chain book shop.</p>
<p>One reason not to include manga is simply that I have no idea how to do include them elegantly. Do I list them by author or illustrator? Many of them have multiple. For now I have settled on including them by name only until I can determine a better way to include them that is more consistent with the rest of the catalog.</p>
<p>If you would like to check out the library, it can be found <a href="https://dunkelheit.xyz/library">here</a>.</p>
