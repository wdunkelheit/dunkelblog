<p>The modern Internet experience for the average Internet user is a strange thing indeed. The compulsive desire to &ldquo;check notis&rdquo; is truly a technological horror and an expression of addictive behavior. Yet many find it to not only be &ldquo;normal&rdquo; but completely acceptable. How bizarre!</p>
<p>When I was younger and I wanted to talk to my friends online I had to open various chat applications to be able to communicate with them all because everyone had just one application that they were comfortable with (or their parents allowed to be installed on the family computer) and it was normal for people to take days or weeks to reply.</p>
<p>Now it seems that is no longer the case, everyone feels some kind of need to be on every platform and expects instantaneous replies regardless of time zones or whether the recipient is awake or busy. It&rsquo;s a very artificial way of interacting with people and it is quite disturbing to think about.</p>
<p>On the topic of being &ldquo;on every platform&rdquo;, I have come to resent the fact that I have started to rely on some of these same platforms myself recently. Although I have been doing this so far without accounts on them (shout out to <a href="https://nitter.net/">nitter</a>!). This makes it very time consuming and exhausting to keep up to date with people that use these platforms exclusively.</p>
<p>Unfortunately there is no realistic solution to this problem when you want to follow more than five or so accounts. Which is why I have recently started to think that it may be a necessary evil to create an account on these platforms for the purpose of following and keeping up to date with certain people, topics, etc.</p>
<p>Which goes against the spirit of what I am trying to do with this blog: being my own platform.</p>
<p>Is it a necessary evil or am I just unaware of a better solution?</p>
<p>I have tried to use fediverse in the past, and while technologically it is a neat technological solution to problems and some cool people are on there that I would like to keep up to date with it falls into the same category of click-chasing habit forming behavior that twitter, etc all infect their users with.</p>
<p>For now I haven&rsquo;t made accounts on these platforms however it is something that I am starting to think about. ü§î</p>
<h3 id="update">Update</h3>
<p>I have decided to try it out and see for myself if it is worth the hassle. You can follow me <a href="https://twitter.com/dunkelheitxyz">@Dunkelheitxyz</a> if you want to. As I mentioned above I intend to just use it to keep up to date with some accounts that don&rsquo;t have or use alternatives.</p>
<h3 id="update-2">Update 2</h3>
<p>I am not impressed with the twitter experience at all. It seems like it has gotten worse over the years. Which would surprise me if I didn&rsquo;t expect this. The issues I pointed out in past posts about the issues being what twitter is as well as how they do it are still present. Ultimately it is designed to suck your time away and keep you engaged in meaningless nonsense. I will keep the account active for a while longer but I likely won&rsquo;t log in to it. Really I just can&rsquo;t be bothered to use it at all, even to delete it.</p>
